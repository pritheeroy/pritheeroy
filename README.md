üëãüèΩ My name is Prithee (Pri-thee), and I am a software engineer who is passionate about solving complex problems using data. 
<br />

üéì I am pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Toronto.
<br />


üíª Currently, I am working at Borealis AI, a research institute at RBC, as a machine learning engineer on the ML Infrastructure Team with a focus on MLOps. I have previously interned at Manulife as a Software Engineer, where I worked on a Quantitative Investment Strategy
System in Java and React.js. I have previously worked as an Automation Developer, automating data entry by setting up 
continuous integration and infrastructure provisioning. I have also worked as an Project Manager where I managed a large‚Äëscale project, handling both the technical and project management aspects simultaneously.
