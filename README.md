üëãüèΩ  My name is Prithee (Pri-thee), and I am a software engineer who is passionate about solving complex problems using data. 
<br />

üéì  I am pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Toronto.
<br />


üíª  Currently, I am working at Borealis AI, a research institute at RBC, as a Machine Learning Software Engineer on the ML Infrastructure Team with a focus on MLOps. I've worked at the University Health Network as a Software Engineer, primarly working with Python and SQL to optimize functions and build ETL pipelines. I have previously interned at Manulife as a Software Engineer, where I worked on a Quantitative Investment Strategy
System in Java and React.js. I have also worked as an Automation Developer, automating data entry by setting up 
continuous integration and infrastructure provisioning.
