üëãüèΩ  My name is Prithee (Pri-thee), and I am a software engineer who is passionate about solving complex problems using data. 
<br />

üéì  I am pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Toronto.
<br />


üíª Currently, I am working at Ripple as a Software Engineer Intern on the Data Platform team. Previously, I worked at Borealis AI, a research institute at RBC, as a Machine Learning Software Engineer on the ML Infrastructure Team with a focus on MLOps. I have also previously interned at Manulife as a Software Engineer, where I worked on a Quantitative Investment Strategy System in Java and React.js.
